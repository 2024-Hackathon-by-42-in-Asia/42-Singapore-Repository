## Project description

pandagather offers users the opportunity to join nearby orders, making delivery more efficient and eco-friendly. Users can browse all available orders, choose one to join, and confirm their participation within a set time limit.

By joining a pandagather, users not only enjoy a small discount on delivery but also contribute to reducing CO2 emissions by combining trips. Each time users participate, they earn points that contribute to their progress through different tiers, represented by unique animal avatars. These avatars are personalized based on the tier animal and the userâ€™s ordering preferences.

Frequent orders from a specific restaurant will trigger notifications when a pandagather is available at that location. Users can activate this feature for each of their saved locations.
